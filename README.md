# Arduino Toys

This is just a couple of toy Arduino projects that I've enjoyed
messing around with.

## ArduinoUtils

This is a nicer C++ API around analog and digital I/O for Arduino projects.
The main benefit is the complete separation between input and output,
so there's no possible way to, say, read from an input pin accidentally.

It also uses C++ constructors to automatically set pin modes and things.

## Clapper

This is an implementation of the Clapper, a.k.a. a machine that
lights an LED after 2 claps.

## StayLoud

This is a dumb box that screams at you until you out-scream it.
